# Treblle with Spring

## Requirements

- Spring Boot 2.4.X
- Java 8+

### Install the SDK

Add the subsequent dependency to your `pom.xml` file while ensuring it aligns with your Spring Boot version:

For Spring Boot `2.4.X` with `Java 8` and higher:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.treblle</groupId>
        <artifactId>treblle-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->
</dependencies>
```

**Note:** Version 1.x is maintained on the `1.x-java8` branch for legacy support.

For Spring Boot `3.X` with `Java 17` and higher:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.treblle</groupId>
        <artifactId>treblle-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.11</version>
    </dependency>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->
</dependencies>
```

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on [treblle.com](https://treblle.com) to get an API key and SDK Token. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your api like so:

Annotate the desired configuration with \`@EnableTreblle\`

```java copy
@EnableTreblle
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    ...
}
```

Configure the following properties:

```txt copy
treblle.apiKey=<API_KEY>
treblle.sdkToken=<SDK_TOKEN>
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle Dashboard. Now you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

## Running Treblle only for certain URL patterns

By default, Treblle applies its filter on the default URL pattern (/\*). If you want to run Treblle only for certain URL patterns, you can define a list of patterns by using the \`treblle.urlPatterns\` configuration property like in the example below.

```csv copy
treblle.urlPatterns=/greeting,/goodbye
```

## Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass field names you want to hide by using the \`treblle.maskingKeywords\` configuration property like in the example below.

```csv copy
treblle.maskingKeywords=secretField,highlySensitiveField
```

## Logging error bodies

The Spring default behavior is to handle errors via the \`/error\` endpoint. To allow Treblle to properly process your error response bodies you should switch to controller based exception handling, for example by using \`@ControllerAdvice\` and \`@ExceptionHandler\` ( https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc )
