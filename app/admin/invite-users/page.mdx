# Invite Users

Inviting users to your Treblle workspace enables team collaboration and ensures the right people have access to your API data. 

As a workspace owner or administrator, you can invite team members and assign appropriate roles based on their responsibilities.

#### Creating Invite Links

   In the "Invite people" section, you'll see the option: "Anyone with a link can join as a workspace member"

2. **Share the Link**
   
   Copy and share the generated invite link with team members who need access.

3. **Link Management**
   
   - Links expire after 24 hours for security
   - Generate new links as needed
   - Monitor who joins through shared links

Invite links automatically assign the "Member" role. You can change roles after users join the workspace.
