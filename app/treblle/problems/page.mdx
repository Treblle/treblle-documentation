# Problems Dashboard

Treblle identifies both codebase and non-codebase errors captured by the Treblle SDK. For instance, it can detect misspellings that might affect your API documentation.

## Steps to view the Problems Tab

1. Click on **Problems** in the left navigation bar.

Treblle performs 15 security checks on every API request and assigns them under **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** threat levels.

## Viewing Problems in Requests

To inspect specific requests with problems, you can:

- **Filter** requests using the **Filter** option ( Requests, User Information, Security & Compliance, Metadata ).
- **Sort** requests using the **SORT BY** option ( Created at, Path, Threat level, Load time ).
- Toggle between table or list views for convenience.
