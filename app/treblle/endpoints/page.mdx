# API Endpoints

Endpoints in Treblle represent the URIs that expose specific parts of your API. 

Once you integrate your API with Treblle, it automatically identifies and organizes these endpoints in the **Endpoints** tab.

## Check Endpoints

For each endpoint, you can view:

- **HTTP Method**: The type of request, e.g., GET, POST.
- **Last Request**: Timestamp of the most recent request.
- **Total Requests**: Total number of requests received.
- **Description**: Brief details about the endpoint.
- **Average Load Time**: The endpoint's average response time.
- **Requests Graph**: A daily visualization of requests made to the endpoint.

### Viewing Requests

To view requests made to a specific endpoint, You can:

- **Filter** requests using the **Filter** option ( Requests, User Information, Security & Compliance, Metadata ).
- **Sort** requests using the **SORT BY** option ( Created at, Path, Threat level, Load time ).
- Toggle between table or list views for convenience.

## Endpoint Options

Each endpoint has additional options accessible from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner:

### Add or Remove an Endpoint from API Docs

- **Add to Docs**: Select **INCLUDE IN DOCS** from the dropdown menu. This makes the endpoint and its details visible in the project's auto-generated API documentation.

- **Remove from Docs**: Select **REMOVE FROM DOCS** to hide the endpoint from the API documentation.

### Mute or Unmute an Endpoint

- **Mute**: Requests to the endpoint will no longer appear in your project, and alerts for that endpoint will stop. Click Mute in the dropdown menu to enable this.

- **Unmute**: To re-enable the visibility of requests and alerts for a muted endpoint, click Unmute in the dropdown menu.

### Add an Alias to an Endpoint

- Click on **EDIT** to assign the endpoint an alias (an alternative name) to make it easier to find during filtering.

- Example:
    For the endpoint `articles/{articleUuid}/favorite`:
    - **Alias Name**: Article Favoriting
    - **Short Description**: Marks an article as a favorite for the user.

### Delete an Endpoint

- Remove the endpoint from the project by selecting **Delete** in the dropdown menu. 

- Deleting an endpoint also removes it from the API documentation and disassociates all related requests.

Treblle automatically organizes endpoints into groups based on their paths. 

For example, `/users/:id` and `/users/verify` are grouped under the **users** group to facilitate filtering and management.
