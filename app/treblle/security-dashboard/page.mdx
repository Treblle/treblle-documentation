# Security Dashboard

Treblle's Security Dashboard provides a unified security view across your entire API landscape, helping you maintain clean APIs and satisfy auditor requirements.

This workspace-level dashboard enables you to detect vulnerabilities, monitor authentication health, and visualize security metrics at scale.

<NoteCard>
The Security Dashboard is available for **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.
</NoteCard>

## What is the Security Dashboard?

The Security Dashboard is a comprehensive security monitoring tool built for your complete API portfolio. It provides:

- **Authentication Analysis**: Detect APIs with weak or missing authentication
- **Zombie Endpoint Detection**: Identify unused or inactive endpoints
- **Security Risk Visualization**: View security metrics by API type, authentication method, BOLA, BFLA, and more
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track security issues across all workspace APIs
- **Customizable Widgets**: Focus on security metrics that matter most to your organization

## Accessing the Security Dashboard

### Navigate to Security

1. **Open Workspace Navigation**
   
   From the left navigation bar at the workspace level, click on **Security**.

## Security Dashboard Widgets

### Overview Widgets

#### Zombie APIs
- **Description**: Number of zombie APIs across your workspace
- **What it shows**: APIs with endpoints that haven't received traffic in an extended period
- **Why it matters**: Zombie endpoints increase attack surface and maintenance burden
- **Metric**: Total count with percentage change over time

#### Security Fail
- **Description**: Number of failed security checks across your APIs
- **What it shows**: APIs failing critical security validations
- **Why it matters**: Indicates immediate security risks requiring attention
- **Metric**: Total count with percentage change trend

#### Problematic APIs
- **Description**: Number of APIs with security problems
- **What it shows**: APIs with detected security issues or vulnerabilities
- **Why it matters**: Helps prioritize remediation efforts
- **Metric**: Total count with percentage change indicator

#### Compliance Fail
- **Description**: Number of failed compliance checks across APIs
- **What it shows**: APIs not meeting regulatory compliance standards
- **Why it matters**: Essential for maintaining GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA compliance
- **Metric**: Total count with percentage change

### Geographic and Network Analysis

#### Risky IPs
- **Description**: World map with risky IP locations
- **What it shows**: Geographic distribution of requests from IP addresses with poor reputation scores
- **Why it matters**: Identifies potential attack sources and geographic threat patterns
- **Visual**: Interactive world map with clustered markers
- **Details**: Click on markers to see specific IP addresses and locations

### Security Audit and Analysis

#### Security Audit
- **Description**: API security risk breakdown and trend analysis
- **What it shows**: 
  - Table of APIs with High Risk and Medium Risk percentages
  - Line graph showing failed request trends over time
- **Why it matters**: Provides quantitative security metrics for risk assessment

#### Authentication Type
- **Description**: List of APIs by authentication method
- **What it shows**: 
  - API name
  - Authentication method (Basic, Bearer, No Auth, Digest, Custom)
  - Security status (Risky, Secure, No Auth)
- **Why it matters**: Quickly identify APIs with weak or missing authentication

### Vulnerability Analysis

#### BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)
- **Description**: APIs with BOLA vulnerabilities
- **What it shows**: 
  - API name
  - BOLA issue count
  - HTTP status code (typically 403 Forbidden)
  - Visual bar chart of vulnerability distribution
- **Why it matters**: BOLA is a critical OWASP API Security Top 10 vulnerability

#### BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization)
- **Description**: APIs with BFLA vulnerabilities
- **What it shows**: 
  - API name
  - BFLA issue count
  - Visual bar chart showing vulnerability severity
- **Why it matters**: Function-level authorization issues can expose privileged operations

The Security Dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your API security posture, enabling proactive threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring across your entire API landscape.
