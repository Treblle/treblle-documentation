# API Documentation

Treblle auto-generates API documentation in real-time. It includes details such as available endpoints, authentication methods, request and response formats, and other essential technical specifications required to integrate and use the API successfully.

## How to View API Docs

1. Click on **API Docs** in the left navigation bar.

2. The API Docs Overview will display the following:

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-documentation/docs-dashboard.png" alt="API Documentation Dashboard" />

- **Load time**: Time it takes to load the API data.
- **Response size**: Size of the API responses.
- **Base URL**: The base URL for your API.
- **[API score](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/api-governance/)**: A score that represents the health and quality of your API.

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-documentation/api-score.png" alt="API Score" />

- **Format**: The format of the API (e.g., JSON).
- **Total number of endpoints**: Total count of API endpoints.
- **API settings**: Includes API details, invite members, API ID, and SDK token.
- **[API catalog](https://docs.treblle.com/features/api-catalog/)**: A repository to publish and manage API documentation for collaboration without granting full API access.

## Authentication

Authentication is vital for verifying the identity of clients accessing the API. With the correct authentication method, you can ensure that only authorized users can interact with the API endpoints.

When making API requests, you'll need to provide the following authentication details:

- **Type:** Specifies the authentication method (e.g., Bearer Token, API Key)
- **Value:** The actual authentication credentials
- **Location:** Where to include the authentication (e.g., Headers, Query Parameters)

## OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard for describing APIs. When it comes to API documentation, OpenAPI spec is a must for every API. 

Under API documentation, Treblle auto-generates API documentation. We support JSON and YAML formats.

To open the documentation in Swagger, click the **Open in Swagger** button on the OpenAPI Specification page.

<NoteCard>
A new OpenAPI Specification URL is generated each time you visit the documentation page. This URL is valid for one hour and expires afterward.
</NoteCard>

## Endpoints

Under API documentation, you can also access all your API endpoints. This lets you quickly navigate to the endpoint you want to work with.

To add or remove an endpoint, please refer to the [Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/endpoints/).

## Alfred AI 

You will find a cute AI assistant jumping around on the API Documentation page. That's [Alfred](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/alfred-ai).

**Alfred** is Treblle's assistant who helps with your API workflows by using your API documentation to provide real-time answers. It makes your integrations faster.

<NoteCard>
[Alfred](https://docs.treblle.com/treblle/alfred-ai) only accesses your API documentation and does not store or analyze your data. Based on your current API setup it helps improve your documentation and integration process.

### Steps to Use Alfred

1. Click on **Alfred** to open the interface.

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-documentation/alfred.png" alt="Alfred Interface" />

2. Use predefined prompts or ask questions to:

   Example: **Help me get started with this API**.

## Resources

For additional context, you can upload PDFs and other information in the Resources section.
