# Monitoring API Compliance

**Scenario**: You need to monitor API compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, CCPA), review security posture, track governance scores, and ensure sensitive data is properly masked.

**Features Used**: 
- API Compliance
- Data Masking
- API Security
- API Governance

---

## Overview

As a compliance officer, you need to:

1. **Monitor Compliance Status**: Track API compliance with GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, and HIPAA
2. **Review Non-Compliant Requests**: Identify and analyze requests that fail compliance checks
3. **Track Security Checks**: Monitor the 13 security checks Treblle performs on every request
4. **Assess Governance Quality**: Review API governance scores and categories
5. **Ensure Data Masking**: Verify sensitive fields are masked at the SDK level

This workflow demonstrates how to use Treblle's compliance monitoring features to track regulatory compliance.

---

## Step 1: Check API Compliance Dashboard

The API Compliance dashboard provides an overview of your API's compliance status.

### Navigate to Compliance Dashboard

1. After logging into Treblle, go to the **Dashboard**
2. The **API Compliance percentage** shows your overall compliance status

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/api-compliance-tab.jpg" alt="API Compliance Widget on Dashboard" />

The dashboard shows:
- **API compliance** widget with percentage (e.g., 62%)

### Access Detailed Compliance View

1. Click the **Compliance** tab in the left-hand menu
2. You'll see the compliance dashboard with two view options:
   - **Calendar View**: Daily compliance tracking
   - **Graph View**: Trend analysis over time

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/compliance.jpg" alt="Compliance Dashboard Overview" />

The compliance overview displays:
- **Overall API Compliance**: Circular gauge showing percentage (97.62% in the example)
- **Fail** indicator if below threshold
- **View requests** link to see non-compliant requests

### Understanding Compliance Metrics

The compliance percentage is broken down by regulation:
- **GDPR**: 90.49% (Fail indicator) - Personal data handling checks
- **PCI**: 100% (Pass) - Payment card data security
- **CCPA**: 100% (Pass) - California consumer privacy
- **HIPAA**: 100% (Pass) - Health information security

<NoteCard>
**Baseline Tracking**: Monitor your compliance percentage daily to identify trends and catch issues early. A sudden drop in compliance indicates new problems that need investigation.
</NoteCard>

---

## Step 2: Review Compliance by Day

Use the Calendar View to track daily compliance and identify problematic periods.

### Using Calendar View

1. In the **Compliance** section, ensure you're in **Calendar View**
2. Hover over any date to see the compliance percentage for that day

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/compliance-calender.jpg" alt="Calendar View with Daily Compliance" />

The Calendar View shows:
- Each date with a **Fail** indicator (red badge)
- Hover tooltip showing compliance percentage (e.g., "16 December, 2025: Failing on 37.32% requests")
- Monthly view for December 2025
- Navigation arrows to switch months

### View Non-Compliant Requests

1. Click on any date in the calendar
2. See all requests flagged as non-compliant for that specific day

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/compliance-requests.jpg" alt="Non-Compliant Requests for Selected Date" />

This shows:
- Filter applied: `Date: 2025-12-10` and `Compliance: Fail`
- Which requests failed compliance checks
- The specific compliance violations
- Request details for investigation (Method, Response, Name, Load time, Threat, Device, AI Agent, Location, Time)

### Using Graph View

Switch to **Graph View** to monitor compliance trends:

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/compliance-graph.jpg" alt="Compliance Graph View" />

The graph shows:
- **Percentage of Failed Requests** over time
- Bar chart for each day in December 2025
- Y-axis showing 0% to 100%
- Easy visualization of compliance trends and patterns

<TipCard>
**Weekly Review**: Check the Graph View every week to identify patterns. If compliance is declining, investigate which APIs or endpoints are causing issues.
</TipCard>

---

## Step 3: Analyze Individual Request Compliance

Review detailed compliance checks for specific requests.

### Navigate to Request Compliance

1. Go to **Requests** section
2. Click on any request to open detailed view
3. Navigate to the **API Compliance** tab

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/compliance-general-tab.jpg" alt="Request API Compliance Tab" />

### Understanding Request Compliance Score

Each request displays:

**Request Compliance Score**: 
- **100%** with green checkmark = "Request Compliance"
- Overall compliance for this specific request

**Individual Regulation Checks**:

The right panel shows expandable sections for each regulation:

**GDPR** (100% - Pass):
- Email
- HomeAddress
- IDCardNumber
- IPAddress
- NameAndSurname

**PCI** (expandable):
- Payment card data security checks

**CCPA** (expandable):
- GeoLocation
- SocialSecurityNumber  

**HIPAA** (expandable):
- MedicalRecordNumber
- HealthInsuranceID
- ICD10DiagnosisCodes
- LabTestResults
- PrescriptionNumbers

**Detailed Information**:
- Each regulation shows specific fields checked
- **Pass** indicators (green) for compliant fields
- Click on any regulation to expand and see all checks performed

### Compliance Checks Overview

Treblle validates requests against multiple standards to ensure:
- Personal data is handled correctly (GDPR)
- Payment information is secured (PCI)
- Privacy requirements are met (CCPA)
- Health information is protected (HIPAA)

<NoteCard>
**Prioritization**: Focus on requests that fail multiple compliance checks first, as these pose the highest regulatory risk. Address PCI DSS and HIPAA violations immediately due to their strict penalties.
</NoteCard>

---

## Step 4: Monitor Security Checks

Treblle performs 13 automated security checks on every API request.

### View Security in Requests

1. Go to **Requests** section
2. Click on any request
3. Navigate to the **Security** tab

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/security-tab.jpg" alt="Security Tab Showing 13 Checks and Threat Levels" />

The Security tab displays:

**Security Audit Graph**:
- Donut chart showing **46% Fail, 54% Pass**
- **Threat with High Impact**: 0
- **Threat with Medium Impact**: 0  
- **Threat with Low Impact**: 6

**Security Audit List**:
All 13 security checks with Status (Fail/Pass), Security Audit name, and Impact level:
- API8 - Security Misconfiguration - Content Type Specification (Fail, Low)
- API9 - Improper Inventory Management - Method Limiting (Fail, Low)
- API8 - Security Misconfiguration - Security Policies (Fail, Low)
- API8 - Security Misconfiguration - Force Secure Connection (Fail, Low)
- API8 - Security Misconfiguration - MIME Sniffing (Fail, Low)
- API8 - Security Misconfiguration - Embedding Prevention (Fail, Low)
- **API10 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs - IP reputation (Pass, High)** ← Expanded showing detailed explanation

### Security Threat Levels

Requests are categorized into three threat levels:

**Low Threat Level** (Low Impact):
- IDs vs UUIDs
- Rate Limiting
- Content Labeling
- MIME Sniffing Protection
- Force Secure Connection
- Embedding Prevention
- Security Policies
- Content-Type Specification
- Method Limiting

**Medium Threat Level**:
- Authorization issues

**High Threat Level** (High Impact):
- SQL Injection
- IP Reputation
- Secure Connection (HTTPS enforcement)

### Understanding IP Reputation Check

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/ip-reputation.jpg" alt="IP Reputation Check Detail" />

When you expand the IP reputation check (API10), you see:

**IP Reputation check evaluates the trustworthiness and reputation of an IP address** based on its historical behavior and associations. It helps identify potential threats, such as spam or malicious activity, by assessing the IP's track record and reputation within the online community.

**Treblle uses it's own network alongside 3rd party** services to check the reputation of your user's IP address.

<CautionCard>
**High Threat Priority**: Address High Threat Level issues immediately. SQL Injection, missing HTTPS, and IP reputation issues pose serious security risks and can lead to compliance violations.
</CautionCard>

---

## Step 5: Review API Governance Score

API Governance measures how well your APIs follow best practices and standards.

### Navigate to API Governance

1. Click on **Governance** in the left navigation bar (API level)
2. View your overall governance dashboard

- Geographic risk assessment
- Network reputation
- Activity patterns
- Threat intelligence databases

<TipCard>
**Risk Assessment Factors**: IPs are flagged based on past malicious activities, geographic risk, hosting network reputation, unusual request patterns, and security feed data.
</TipCard>

---

## Step 8: Verify Data Masking Configuration

Data masking ensures sensitive information is secured before being sent to Treblle.

### Understanding Data Masking

**Important**: Data masking happens at the **SDK level**, not in the Treblle UI. It must be configured when integrating Treblle into your application.

### How Data Masking Works

Data masking is integrated into all Treblle SDKs:
- Masking happens **at the programming level**
- Data is masked **before leaving your server**
- Sensitive fields are replaced with stars (`*****`)

### Default Masked Fields

Treblle SDKs automatically mask these fields:
- `password`
- `pwd`
- `secret`
- `password_confirmation`
- `passwordConfirmation`
- `cc`
- `card_number`
- `cardNumber`
- `ccv`
- `ssn`
- `credit_score`
- `creditScore`
- `api_key`

### Custom Field Masking

You can define additional fields to mask during SDK integration.

**Example: Express.js**

```javascript
app.use(
    treblle({
        apiKey: process.env.TREBLLE_API_KEY,
        sdkToken: process.env.TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN,
        additionalFieldsToMask: ['email', 'phone_number'],
    })
);
```

### Verify Masking in Treblle

<ImageCard src="/workflow/compliance/platform.jpg" alt="Masked Data Example in General Tab" />

In the Treblle platform, masked fields appear with stars in the request body:

**REQUEST**:
```json
{
  "email": "*****************",
  "phone_number": "***********"
}
```

**RESPONSE**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "email": "*****************",
    "phone_number": "***********"
  },
  "message": "User registered successfully!"
}
```

The masked data shows:
- Length matches original data (number of asterisks)
- Value completely hidden
- Applied to both requests and responses

### Masking Scope

Data masking applies to:
- Request and response headers
- Request and response data
- Arrays of any depth
- Object keys and values

**Special Case - Authorization Header**:
Only the API key value is masked, not the authentication type.

Example:
```
Bearer lsGPLl4k6Vc4J0VhnFaMBqetNtn1ofsB
```

Becomes:
```
Bearer ********************************
```

<CautionCard>
**SDK Configuration Required**: Data masking must be configured in your SDK integration code. There is no UI in Treblle to configure masking. Refer to your SDK documentation for specific implementation details.
</CautionCard>

- Include in regulatory documentation
- Archive for compliance records
- Provide to external auditors

**CSV/Excel Exports**:
- Analyze compliance trends over time
- Create custom charts and visualizations
- Filter and sort non-compliant requests
- Track remediation progress
- Generate custom reports

<TipCard>
**Regular Exports**: Download weekly or monthly compliance reports to maintain a historical record of your compliance posture. This documentation is valuable during audits and regulatory reviews.
</TipCard>
