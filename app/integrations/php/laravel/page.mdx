## Features

## Requirements

- Laravel 10, 11, 12

## Dependencies

- [`laravel/framework`](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)
- [`guzzlehttp/guzzle`](https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/guzzle)

## Installation

Install Treblle for Laravel via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require treblle/treblle-laravel
```

Create an account, login to your existing account, create a new project and get all the `.ENV` keys you need to start using Treblle.

You can also visit our website [https://app.treblle.com](https://app.treblle.com) and create a FREE account to get your API key and SDK token. Once you have them, simply add them to your `.ENV` file:

```shell
TREBLLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN=YOUR_SDK_TOKEN
```

## Enabling Treblle on your API

<NoteCard>
In case you want to temporarily disable observability, you can do so by setting env as `TREBLLE_ENABLE=false`

We've created a comprehensive, hands-on guide to building your Laravel API. Check out our [Laravel API Course](https://apiacademy.treblle.com/laravel-api-course/) for a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough.

## Upgrading from v5.x to v6.0

Version 6.0 introduces breaking changes to environment variable names. If you're upgrading from v5.x:

**1. Update your `.env` file:**

```shell
# Old configuration (v5.x)
TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_old_api_key
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=your_old_project_id

# New configuration (v6.0)
TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN=your_old_api_key
TREBLLE_API_KEY=your_old_project_id
```

**2. If using dynamic middleware parameters, update route definitions:**

```php
// Old (v5.x)
Route::middleware(['treblle:project-id-1'])->group(function () { ... });

// New (v6.0)
Route::middleware(['treblle:api-key-1'])->group(function () { ... });
```

**3. Clear caches:**

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## Configuration options

You can configure Treblle using just `.env` variables:

```shell
TREBLLE_IGNORED_ENV=local,dev,test
```

Define which environments Treblle should NOT LOG at all. By default, Treblle will log all environments except local, dev and test. If you want to change that you can define your own ignored environments by using a comma separated list, or allow all environments by leaving the value empty.

### Masked fields

Treblle **masks sensitive information** from both the request and response data as well as the request headers data **before it even leaves your server**. The following parameters are automatically masked: password, pwd, secret, password_confirmation, cc, card_number, ccv, ssn, credit_score.

You can customize this list by editing your configuration file. 

Open file `config/treblle.php` and tweak the masked fields:

```php
return [
    // ...

    /*
     * Define which fields should be masked before leaving the server
     */
    'masked_fields' => [
        'password',
        'pwd',
        'secret',
        'password_confirmation',
        'cc',
        'card_number',
        'ccv',
        'ssn',
        'credit_score',
        'api_key',
    ],
];
```
