- requests

## Examples

### Basic Usage

You can use Treblle with Flask by importing the Treblle class and passing your Flask app to the constructor.

```python
from treblle_flask import Treblle

app = Flask(__name__)
Treblle(app)

@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Advanced Usage

You can also pass your Treblle API key and project ID to the Treblle constructor.

```python
from treblle_flask import Treblle

app = Flask(__name__)
Treblle(app, TREBLLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY", TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID")

@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables to configure Treblle without passing any arguments to the Treblle constructor:

- `TREBLLE_API_KEY`: Your Treblle API key
- `TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Treblle project ID

Using environment variables is the recommended approach for managing your Treblle credentials, especially in production environments.
