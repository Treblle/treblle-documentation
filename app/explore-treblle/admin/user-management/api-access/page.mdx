# API Access Management

<NoteCard>
**Enterprise Feature**: Granular API access management is available exclusively for Enterprise workspaces.
</NoteCard>

## Overview

API Access is the bridge between your workspace members and your APIs. It controls which users and groups can access specific APIs within your workspace, allowing you to:

- Grant API access to individual users or entire groups
- Manage who can see and interact with each API
- Maintain security by controlling access at the API level
- Simplify onboarding with group-based access

## How API Access Works

### The Connection System

API Access works in conjunction with [Roles](/explore-treblle/admin/roles-and-permissions) and [Groups](/explore-treblle/admin/user-management/groups):

1. **Roles** define what users **can do** (permissions)
2. **Groups** organize users into **teams**
3. **API Access** determines which APIs users **can see and use**

<CautionCard>
  **Important**: Having a role with permissions does NOT automatically grant access to APIs. Users must be explicitly granted API access either individually or through group membership.
</CautionCard>

### Access Methods

Users can access an API through two methods:

#### 1. Direct Access (Individual)
- User is explicitly added to the API
- Maintains access regardless of group membership
- Useful for specific individual needs

#### 2. Group Access
- User's group has been granted access to the API
- User automatically gains/loses access when added/removed from group
- Preferred method for team-based access management

### Example Scenario

**Setup:**
- User: Sarah
- Role: Developer (with permissions to read requests and manage endpoints)
- Group: Frontend Team
- API: Web Application API

**Without API Access:**
- Sarah has the Developer role
- Sarah is in the Frontend Team group
- Sarah **cannot see** the Web Application API

**With API Access:**
- Frontend Team group is granted access to Web Application API
- Sarah **can now see** the Web Application API
- Sarah can use her Developer role permissions on this API

## Viewing API Access

Navigate to **User Management > API Access** to see all APIs and their access configurations.

### API Access Table

The table displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | API name and identifier |
| **People** | Number of individual users with direct access |
| **Groups** | Number of groups with access to this API |

### Filtering

Use filters to find specific access configurations:

**Filter by People:**
- Shows APIs where specific users have access
- Useful for auditing individual user access

**Filter by Groups:**
- Shows APIs where specific groups have access
- Useful for reviewing team access patterns

## Managing API Access

### View API Access Details

Click **View API Access** from the menu (•••) to see detailed access information:

**API Information:**
- API name and URL
- Created date

**Access Details:**
- Number of people with direct access
- Number of groups with access
- Complete lists of both

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-access/individual-api.jpg" alt="Individual API Access" />

### Granting Access

#### Add Individual Users

1. Open the API access detail view
2. Navigate to the **People** section
3. Click **+ Add** next to "Search by name or email..."
4. Select one or more users from the dropdown
5. Click **Add**

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-access/add-member.jpg" alt="Individual Add Member" />

<NoteCard>
  **Multi-Select**: You can add multiple users at once by selecting them all before clicking Add.
</NoteCard>

**What Happens:**
- Selected users immediately gain access to the API
- They can now see the API in their workspace
- They can use their role permissions on this API
- Access is maintained even if they leave any groups

#### Add Groups

1. Open the API access detail view
2. Navigate to the **Groups** section
3. Click **+ Add** next to "Search..."
4. Select one or more groups from the dropdown
5. Click **Add**

<ImageCard src="/platform/api-access/grant-access-to-group.jpg" alt="Add Group" />

**What Happens:**
- All members of selected groups immediately gain access to the API
- New members added to these groups automatically get API access
- Members removed from these groups lose API access (unless they have direct access)

<TipCard>
  **Best Practice**: Use group-based access for teams. This makes it easier to onboard new team members and maintain consistent access across your organization.
</TipCard>

### Revoking Access

#### Remove Individual Users

**Single User:**
1. Find the user in the People list
2. Click the menu (•••) next to the user
3. Select **Revoke Access**
4. Confirm the action

**Bulk Removal:**
1. Check the boxes next to users to remove
2. Click **Revoke Access** from the bulk action menu
3. Confirm the action
4. All selected users will lose access

#### Remove Groups

**Single Group:**
1. Find the group in the Groups list
2. Click the menu (•••) next to the group
3. Select **Revoke Access**
4. Confirm the action

**Bulk Removal:**
1. Check the boxes next to groups to remove
2. Click **Revoke Access** from the bulk action menu
3. Confirm the action
4. All members of selected groups will lose access (unless they have direct access)

<CautionCard>
  **Impact Warning**: Revoking group access affects all group members. Make sure you understand the impact before removing group access, especially for large groups.
</CautionCard>

#### Revoke All Access

<CautionCard>
  **Critical Action**: This removes ALL access (both people and groups) to the API. This action cannot be undone.
</CautionCard>

To revoke all access:
1. Open the API access detail view
2. Click **Revoke All Access**
3. Read the warning carefully
4. Type `REVOKE` to confirm
5. Click **Revoke All Access**

**What Happens:**
- All individual users lose access
- All groups lose access
- API becomes inaccessible to all workspace members
- You'll need to re-grant access to restore it

## Understanding Access Priority

When a user has both direct access and group access:

**Direct Access + Group Access = Access Maintained**

Example:
- Sarah has direct access to API A
- Sarah is in Frontend Team
- Frontend Team has access to API A
- Removing Sarah from Frontend Team: She still has access (direct access)
- Revoking Frontend Team access: Sarah still has access (direct access)
- Must revoke Sarah's direct access to remove her access completely

<TipCard>
  **Access Auditing**: To completely remove a user's access, check both direct access and group access. Remove both if necessary.
