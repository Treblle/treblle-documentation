## Role and Group Assignment

### Understanding User Roles

- Each user can have **only one role** at a time
- Roles determine what permissions the user has across the workspace
- Changing a user's role immediately updates their permissions
- Users maintain the same role across all APIs they can access

### Understanding User Groups

- Each user can belong to **only one group** at a time
- Groups are used to organize users and grant API access collectively
- Users can be added to a group during invitation or after joining
- Removing a user from a group doesn't change their role

<TipCard>
**Best Practice**: Use groups to organize users by team or department (e.g., "Frontend Team", "Backend Team"), then assign API access to groups rather than individual users. This makes it easier to manage access as your team grows.
