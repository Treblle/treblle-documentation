# People Management

Manage who has access to your Treblle workspace by inviting team members and customers, assigning roles, and controlling permissions.

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/people-tab.png" alt="People Tab" />

## Overview

The People Management section allows you to:

- Invite team members and customers to your workspace
- Assign roles with specific permissions
- Manage user access and remove users when needed
- Control who can view APIs, requests, and documentation

## User Roles

Treblle provides several user roles with different permission levels:

### Owner Role
- Full administrative access
- Can manage all workspace settings
- Can invite and remove users
- Can assign and modify roles
- Can access all APIs and data

### Member Role
- Standard team member access
- Can view assigned APIs
- Can view requests and documentation
- Cannot modify workspace settings
- Cannot manage other users

### Customer Role

<InfoCard type="individual">
    <InfoCard.title>Customer ID Uniqueness Required</InfoCard.title>
    <InfoCard.description>
        Customer IDs must be globally unique across your workspace. Treblle uses exact matching on the user-id field in the treblle-metadata header to filter data.
    </InfoCard.description>
</InfoCard>

<NoteCard>
**Automatic API Access for Customers**: When you invite a user with the Customer role, they automatically gain access to APIs where their customer ID appears:
- **Full API Documentation**: Complete access to API docs, endpoints, and specifications
- **Personal Usage Data**: Request history and analytics limited exclusively to their customer ID
</NoteCard>

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/workspace.jpg" alt="Customer workspace view showing APIs list" />

When a customer user logs in, they will see:

**Dashboard Analytics:**
- Overview metrics (total requests, failed requests, response times)
- Performance charts and trends
- Recent request activity
- Error tracking and monitoring

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/dashboard.jpg" alt="Customer dashboard with analytics and performance metrics" />

**Complete API Documentation (for relevant APIs only):**
- Full endpoint specifications and parameters for APIs with their customer ID
- Authentication methods and requirements
- Request/response schemas and examples
- OpenAPI specifications

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/docs.jpg" alt="Customer API documentation view" />

**Personal Usage Data Only:**
- Request history containing their customer ID
- Performance metrics for their requests only
- Error logs for their requests
- Usage analytics showing their consumption patterns
- Device and location data for their requests

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/requests.jpg" alt="Customer requests view filtered by customer ID" />

**Privacy Protection:**
- Customers see complete API documentation for APIs where their ID appears
- Customers see ONLY requests containing their customer ID
- Other customers' requests remain completely hidden
- APIs without their customer ID are not visible
- Aggregate workspace metrics are not visible

**How it works:**

1. Invite a customer user to your workspace with the Customer role
2. Ensure API requests include the customer's identifier in the `treblle-metadata` header:

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/metadata.jpg" alt="treblle-metadata header structure showing user-id and Plan fields" />
```javascript
   req.headers['treblle-metadata'] = JSON.stringify({
     'user-id': 'Netflix',              // Must be globally unique
     'Plan': 'Titanium Plan'            // Optional additional metadata
   });
```
3. The customer automatically sees:
   - Full API documentation for APIs where their customer ID appears
   - Only their own request history and usage data
4. No manual API access configuration needed

<CautionCard>
**Critical**: Ensure your customer IDs are unique across your entire workspace. The same customer ID will aggregate data across all APIs, so using consistent, unique identifiers is essential for proper data isolation.
</CautionCard>

## Inviting Users

### Email Invite

The most direct way to invite users to your workspace:

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/email-invite.png" alt="Email Invite" />

#### Steps to Send Email Invitations

1. Navigate to **User Management > People**
2. Click the **Email Invite** tab
3. Fill in the invite details:
   - **Email**: Enter the user's email address (required)
   - **Role**: Select a role from the dropdown (required)
   - **Group**: Optionally assign the user to a group
4. Click **Send Invite**

The user will receive an email invitation to join your workspace with the specified role and group assignment.

<NoteCard>
**Multiple Invites**: Click the **+** button to add multiple email addresses and send bulk invitations with the same role and group.
</NoteCard>

### Bulk Invite via CSV

<CautionCard>
**Enterprise Feature**: Bulk CSV invites are available for Enterprise workspaces only.
</CautionCard>

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/bulk-invite.png" alt="Bulk Invite" />

For inviting multiple users at once:

1. Navigate to **User Management > People**
2. Click the **Bulk Invite** tab
3. Prepare your CSV file with three columns:
   - `email` (required)
   - `role` (required)
   - `group` (optional)

**Example CSV format:**
```csv
email,role,group
john.smith@example.com,Developer,Engineering
jane.doe@example.com,QA Engineer,Quality Assurance
mike.jones@example.com,Product Manager,Product
```

4. Drag and drop your CSV file or click to upload
5. Click **Upload**

The system will automatically send invitations to all valid email addresses in the file.

### Join with Link

Create shareable invitation links that anyone can use to join your workspace:

<CautionCard>
**Security Note**: Anyone with the link can join your workspace with the assigned role and group. Share these links carefully and consider the 24-hour expiration.
</CautionCard>

1. Navigate to **User Management > People**
2. Check the box **"Anyone with a link can join this workspace"**
3. Configure the link settings:
   - **Role**: Select a role (required)
   - **Group**: Optionally select a group
4. Click **Generate**

<ImageCard src="/platform/people/invite-with-link.png" alt="Link Invite" />

**Link Features:**
- Each link expires in 24 hours
- You can create multiple links with different role/group combinations
- Links cannot be edited after generation
- Links can be individually regenerated or deleted

<NoteCard>
**Important**: Unchecking "Anyone with a link can join this workspace" will immediately delete all active invitation links.

## Role and Group Assignment

### Understanding User Roles

- Each user can have **only one role** at a time
- Roles determine what permissions the user has across the workspace
- Changing a user's role immediately updates their permissions
- Users maintain the same role across all APIs they can access

### Understanding User Groups

- Each user can belong to **only one group** at a time
- Groups are used to organize users and grant API access collectively
- Users can be added to a group during invitation or after joining
- Removing a user from a group doesn't change their role

<TipCard>
**Best Practice**: Use groups to organize users by team or department (e.g., "Frontend Team", "Backend Team"), then assign API access to groups rather than individual users. This makes it easier to manage access as your team grows.
