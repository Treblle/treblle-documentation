# API Compliance

<YoutubeEmbed postId="D6bdO84P458" />

The API Compliance feature helps you ensure your API adheres to regulatory requirements such as [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), [CCPA](https://doca.gov.in/ccpa/), and [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) by identifying sensitive data within API requests and responses.

## Steps to Use API Compliance

### 1. Check the Dashboard

- After logging into Treblle, go to the **Dashboard**.
- The **API Compliance percentage** overviews your API's compliance status.

### 6. View Individual Request Compliance

- Treblle performs real-time compliance validation against multiple standards:

  - **PCI DSS**: Validates credit card data protection and payment information security
  - **CCPA**: Monitors California consumer data privacy requirements
  - **HIPAA**: Ensures health information privacy and security standards
- Each request displays a **Request Compliance Score** (percentage) and individual pass/fail status for each regulation.
- Click on any compliance standard to see specific checks performed and detailed explanations of what was validated.
