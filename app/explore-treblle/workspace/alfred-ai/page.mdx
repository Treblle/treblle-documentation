# Alfred AI

### What is Alfred AI?

[Alfred](https://treblle.com/product/alfred) is Treblle's AI assistant. It helps improve your API workflows by using your API documentation to provide real-time answers.

<NoteCard>
Alfred accesses only your API documentation and does not store or analyze your data. Based on your current API setup it helps you improve your documentation and integration process.
</NoteCard>

### Monitoring Alfred Usage

Alfred AI provides a comprehensive dashboard where you can track how your team is using the AI assistant. This helps you understand usage patterns, identify popular queries, and optimize your API documentation based on real team interactions.

#### Accessing the Alfred Dashboard

- Navigate to the Alfred AI section in your Treblle workspace
- Click on the "Analytics" or "Usage" tab to view the dashboard

Review metrics such as:

- Most frequently asked questions
- Team member activity
- Popular API endpoints being queried
- Usage trends over time

This dashboard insight helps you identify knowledge gaps in your documentation and understand which parts of your API your team needs the most help with.

There are several ways to use Alfred:

- Integrating with Treblle SDK.
- Uploading your OpenAPI Specification.
- Embedding Alfred to your Developer Portal.

### Uploading your OpenAPI Specification

If you are not integrating the Treblle SDK, you can upload your [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (version 3 or above) directly to the Treblle platform.

<NoteCard>
To keep Alfred's information up to date, you must manually update the specification whenever changes occur.

#### Step 1: Access OpenAPI Specification

Go to the API Setting section of your Treblle workspace.

### Embedding Alfred to your Developer Portal

To embed Alfred into your developer portal, follow these steps:

1. Add a one-line script to your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://assets.treblle.com/alfred@1.0.3.js"></script>
   ```

   Place the script before your portal's `</body>` tag to ensure smooth page rendering.

2. Replace `_YOUR_TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN_` with your API ID and `_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_` with your SDK TOKEN.

   ```javascript copy
   <div
     class="getalfred-io"
     data-api="_YOUR_TREBLLE_SDK_TOKEN_"
     data-auth="_YOUR_CUSTOMER_API_KEY_"
   ></div>
   ```
